Privacy Policy for my Chrome Extensions

Anti-Duplicate does not collect, transmit, or share any user data. All tab URL and title data is processed entirely within your browser for the sole purpose of detecting duplicate tabs. No information is sent to any external server.
Settings are stored locally and optionally synced across your devices via Chrome's built-in Sync API, which is managed by Google and tied to your own Google account.
This extension does not use analytics, tracking, or any third-party services.
